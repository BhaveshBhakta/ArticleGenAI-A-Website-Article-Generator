According to a recent study by Forrester, the bank's AI approach has yielded impressive results, with its AI-powered virtual assistant, Erica, handling 2.7 billion client interactions since its launch in 2018. But what sets Bank of America's AI strategy apart, and what lessons can other industries learn from its success?\n",
